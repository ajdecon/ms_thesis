The self-assembly of colloidal particles into larger structures is of 
interest in a wide variety of scientific and practical applications such as
the study of self-assembly~\cite{glotzer-solomon} and the fabrication of 
photonic crystals~\cite{vos-photonic, yang-photonic} and 
three-dimensional templates for tissue-engineering 
scaffolds.~\cite{zhang-tissue}  However,
the range of possible structures which may be formed by the self-assembly
of spherical particles is narrow, encompassing only a few different 
possibilities.  To address this limitation and enable the production of 
a wider range of structures, one solution is to alter the
self-assembly characteristics by introducing particles with one or more forms of 
anisotropy.

In this work, we study the fabrication and behavior of polymeric microparticles 
which incorporate several different forms of anisotropy.
Simple rod-shaped particles are fabricated 
by stop-flow lithography~\cite{dendukuri-sfl} using both hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic materials, as well as Janus particles which incorporate both 
materials in a single particle.  The dynamical
behavior and self-assembly of these rods are investigated using 
fluorescence and confocal microscopy over a range
of different aspect ratios and environmental conditions.  We also develop
image processing algorithms to enable the quantitative analysis of 
these materials, adapting standard particle identification and tracking
techniques to the analysis of rod-shaped colloids.
In addition, we demonstrate the fabrication of Januns particles with 
branched and more complex morphologies, and briefly explore
the self-assembly of these ``patchy'' particles.
