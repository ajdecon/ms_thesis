\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Any scientific project which is not completely trivial is the work
of many different people, and this project is no exception.  
First of all I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Jennifer
Lewis: without her ideas and support this project would simply
not exist, and her guidance has been crucial throughout my work.
Professor Jacinta Conrad and Dr.
Robert Shepherd were immensely important to this work, 
providing assistance and support throughout 
most of my graduate career.  They taught me everything I know 
about working with colloidal materials and microfluidics, and were
kind enough to answer many questions which I often could not even
properly articulate.  I owe special thanks to my undergraduate
assistants, Alissa Cote, Stephen Menke, Fatima Salazar and 
Kundan Chaudhary: they all spent a lot of time on that microscope
with me, and I can't imagine how I could have done without them.
I would also like to thank the rest of the Lewis Group for 
many things, great and small and too numerous to mention, all of
which made my life much easier; in particular Chris Hansen,
John Vericella, David Lorang, Elizabeth Glogowski and Willie Wu.
And Steve Kranz, who is taking over much of my work in the Lewis
group, I thank and wish good luck.

As much as graduate school seems to be the entirety of one's life
while it's going on, the rest of the world does in fact exist! 
With this in mind I would also like to extend thanks to those
who transformed these years of my life into more than one long 
slog in the lab. Mom, Dad and Brian were my rocks, and more important
than I can express without adding a second volume to this book.  
Dr. Huaibin Zhang was kind enough to give me fascinating things to
work on when I wasn't busy with this thesis; and Max, Phil and Steve
gave me games to play when I was done with that, too.  
The Lewis group as a whole have been more than just my colleagues,
and I thank them all for much fun and merriment. Dorian, Moki, 
and Tink have been the truest friends I had when I needed them most, 
and deserve all the thanks and praise I can give them.  And most of 
all I thank Leigh, without whom I would still be lost and alone in the
woods.  This is for you.

I know I've left people out, and to them I give my sincerest apologies.
I could not list everyone without destroying the illusion that this 
work is, in fact, about colloids.
The past few years have been hard and crazy and amazing, and I wouldn't trade them for
anything.  Thank you all.
