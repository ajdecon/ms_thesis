\chapter{Computerized Tracking of Anisotropic Colloids}
\section{Introduction}

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a powerful technique for the study of three-dimensional
structure in fluorescent materials. When applied to fluorescent colloids, CLSM enables the observation
and identification of individual particles, determining their positions in three-dimensional space.
These particle locations alone can be used to derive a great deal
of information about the material, such as the distribution of number of nearest neighbors and
the pair distribution function (PDF). Repeated observations at regular intervals allow for dynamical
measurements of parameters such as the diffusion constant, and may be used to study the microstructual
differences between different parts of the colloidal phase diagram. 

The production of 3D structural information requires more than just a powerful imaging technique: it also
requires powerful computational analysis to translate image data into a list of particles and positions, and
to determine the relevant physical data from this list. 

\section{Literature review}
\tempfigure{Illustration of Solomon technique}
\tempfigure{SFL particles as 2D extruded objects; flat fluorescence}
\begin{itemize}
\statement{Desirable to locate anisotropic particles in microscopy images to study dynamics and assembly.}
\statement{Previous work in this area: Crocker and Grier, Solomon}
\statement{Can't use Solomon method: fluorescence is too flat for SFL particles. 2D-extruded objects. (Figure to illustrate.)}
\statement{Must develop new algorithms which can work on these particles.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\done{Initial steps same as for rods: cleanup, segmentation}
\done{``Skeletonization'' as above, but producing a more complex skeleton than for rods}
\done{Calculate center-of-mass as with rods}
\done{Choose a sample skeleton as the ``canonical'' particle skeleton}
\done{Isolate particles into individual windows}

rotated skeleton and the sample skeleton.  Maximize pixel sum of ANDed image.}
